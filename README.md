## ðŸ“„ Overview

Crystalline polymorphism â€” the ability of a molecule to crystallize in more than one form â€” poses significant challenges in materials science and pharmaceuticals.  
This work investigates whether **single-molecule descriptors and quantum chemical properties** can predict the likelihood of polymorphism without requiring prior crystallographic data.

The repository includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature extraction scripts.
- Quantum chemical descriptor calculation (Gaussian, RDKit, etc.).
- Statistical analysis and machine learning models.
- Figure generation for publication.
